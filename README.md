# Ephem

Ephemeris program for 24x80 character display.

If you are looking for a screen-based astronomical ephemeris program with that retro look, or just want something very small and efficient, try ephem. It was written almost 30 years ago in C and still compiles on just about any UNIX platform (including Linux and Mac OS X) and even VMS and Windows. The output is always 24 rows and 80 columns, just like the old glass TTYs.

Grab what you want from below:
* [User Manual](INFO)
* Sample [ephem.cfg](ephem.cfg) and [ephem.db](ephem.db) (put them in the same folder as the executable) 

If you want something a little more modern, take a look at [XEphem](https://github.com/XEphem/XEphem).

Enjoy!
